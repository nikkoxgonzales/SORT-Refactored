# SORT-Refactored
SORT-Refactored is a cleaned-up and optimized version of the Simple Online and Realtime Tracker (SORT) codebase originally developed by Alex Bewley. The code has been refactored for clarity and maintainability, with optimized loops and naming conventions. We've removed all non-essential code, including the if __name__ == "__main__" block and argument parsing, making SORT-Refactored fully importable and easy to integrate into existing projects. Although the performance of the code remains similar to the original, we believe that the refactored version is more readable and easier to work with. If you're looking for a clean, efficient, and easy-to-use object tracking solution, give SORT-Refactored a try!
